For me, in View.java I will extend JFrame and JPanel and I will create the method to solve the Encode_Panel class, Decode_Panel class, Image_Panel class because of these three are hard to access and it is nested class. In Controller.java the controller should implement ActionListener and has only one actionPerformed to handle the action and create method instead of EncodeButton class, DecodeButton class because these two classes are nested class and it will hard to edit in the future. In Image.java and Image_Filter.java, handle about image and Image.java class can extends javax.swing.filechooser.FileFilter so Image.java can do everything like Image_Filter.java. And finally, View.java can merge with Controller.java like figureViewer.java that has actionPerformed and does everything in one class. Their codes are hard to read, they don't follow the coding standard.
